<p>Owners are positioned such that they can make decisions about how their area operates and evolves, and are a key part of driving and expanding capabilities at Makespace.</p>

<p>
Hence  Owners are organised in teams with authority to:
	<ul>
		<li>Train and authorise members to use Makespace equipment</li>
		<li>Maintain equipment and make improvements </li>
		<li>Purchase items needed for members to use Makespace resources safely.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>These authorities are delegated to individual owners by the Directors of Makespace Cambridge Ltd.</p>

<p>Owner teams are organised around specific equipment, activities or resources and are the designated point-of-contact for all of Makespace for that resource.  This is critical to enabling Makespace to operate and to scale, while keeping overhead and bureaucracy low.</p>

<p>Ownership is a team effort. Responsibilities, generally, are shared by several individuals with some focusing on maintenance, safety or new capabilities, while others might focus primarily on delivering training. It is important that the team as a whole fulfills the needs of Makespace and its members with respect to their particular equipment or resources.</p>

<p>
Owner Teams:
<ul>
   <li> Implement training, conduct maintenance, manage consumables and generally ensure the smooth-running of their equipment.</li>
   <li> Have a mandate to improve their area’s activities and grow Makespace’s capabilities to meet the aspirations of members </li>
   <li> Keep the workshops safe by championing good working practices.</li>
   <li> Keep documentation up-to-date, thus fulfilling vital compliance and insurance requirements covering Makespace, members and guests. </li>
   <li> Are supported with budget,  purchasing infrastructure, Makespace’s administration.</li>
   <li> Are covered and protected by Makespace insurance and compliance systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The intent is that members benefit from enthusiastic, experienced and proactive Owners.</p>
<p>By signing this agreement you are agreeing to be an Owner with the responsibilities and authorities stated above for this Owner Team.</p>
